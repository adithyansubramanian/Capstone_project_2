# Capstone_project_2

This is a repository for my second capstone project completed for Springboard's Data Science career track. Here, I attempt to predict amazon ratings based on text from reviews.

# Getting started
## Prerequisities
Your system must have python with the following libraries installed: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, NLTK, imblearn, scikit-learn, and scipy.

## Installing
To start please download the csv file. This is the dataset used for the project. Next download and run the jupyter notebook. Also in this repository are 2 milestone reports, a final report, and a final presentation.

## Author
This project was created by me, Adithyan Subramanian, with the help of my mentor, Mukesh Mithrakumar. I can be easily reached by email at adithyan.subramanian19@gmail.com.
